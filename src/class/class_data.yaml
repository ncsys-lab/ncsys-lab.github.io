      This short assignment is meant to get a basic Unix-compatible shell environment set up on your computer.  We'll do this together in class during the first lecture.

      We defined what "the shell" is, went over the history/background of the UNIX operating system and the shell as we know it today, and covered how to use basic shell commands.

      Useful Resources:
        * `man` pages (the system manual)
        * [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh)
        * [devhints.io/bash](https://devhints.io/bash)

      I used a non-standard command `bat` in my lecture demo; the software installation page contains installation instructions if you want to try it out.
